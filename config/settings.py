#
#      Design rationale by class:
#        Crypto       — momentum boosted (1.8×) because crypto prices are driven by fast-moving
#                       momentum and liquidity cycles rather than fundamentals; context downweighted
#                       (0.5×) because crypto is largely uncorrelated with broad macro indices.
#        Tech Stocks  — sentiment boosted (1.6×) because earnings releases and news headlines are
#                       the primary price-movers for large-cap tech.
#        Commodities  — trend boosted (1.3×) to capture multi-week supply/demand cycles; RSI
#                       downweighted (0.8×) as commodities can trend far beyond typical RSI extremes.
#        Market Indices — trend (1.5×) and context (1.5×) are primary because indices represent
#                         aggregate market direction and ARE the broad macro context themselves;
#                         RSI heavily downweighted (0.5×) as index RSI rarely gives clean signals.
